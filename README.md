# My climbing drills

### An open source social climbing training app

## Features

- Create your own training schedule and your own exercises with the available widgets
- Or, start from another user's template, or an available trainer's template
- Share your new template with the community
- Vote on other users training plans and exercises
- Log your trainings and see your progess over time
- Dynamic calendar with drag and drop features to move your training days and exercises around
- Build a profile and exchange with other passionate rock climbers

Note: it's mostly a personal project of mine to test some new stacks and technologies. I did a few different versions over the past few months, but I think this version will be my final chosen stack (GEMS - GraphQL, Express, MongoDB, Svelte)

Other note: I will start in mobile first, so sorry for the broken design on desktop!

If anybody's eventually interested in participating or see potential in that app, please contact me.
